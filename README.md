## Haraj Challenge
Welcome to Haraj challenge!

In this repository you will find a sample app ready for implementation. 

You will find icons and a json file containing the data you'll need to complete this challenge.


## Your Mission

Create a functional app with two screens to display information about Posts from Haraj website.

First, a screen showing a list of Posts from the json file you'll find in `assets` folder.


<div class="column">
<img src="list.png" height="450" alt="First Screen">
  <img src="grid.png" height="450" alt="First Screen">
  <img src="square.png" height="450" alt="First Screen">
</div>

Second, a screen that displays the information of a particular Post upon click events on the previous screen's list.

<img src="detail.png" height="450" alt="Second Screen">

The share button should open up Android's native share sheet to share the title of the Post with other apps.
